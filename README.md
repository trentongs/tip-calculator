# tip-calculator
Independent app project that I created in early 2020.

Using Android Studio, I programmed my own personal tip calculator app that I have ended up using when going out to restaurants (before the recent pandemic).   I came up with the idea for this app because I was annoyed with the monotonous process of using my phone's calculator app to calculate tips one by one and therefore developed my own app to help save myself some time at future outings.  

My app automatically gives me multiple tip amounts (15%, 20%, 25% tips) as well as the total bill corresponding to each tip amount just from entering the restaurant bill and number of people who are paying.
